Deft, a Dylan Environment For Tools
===================================

Deft is a framework for producing tools for building and working
with Dylan projects.  Projects can customize the behavior by
providing a ``deft-package.json`` file.

It is extensible and will support plug-in loading in the future.

It is currently under development.
